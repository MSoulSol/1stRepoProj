				<h3>About Me:</h3>
					<h4>My hometown is Charlotte.</h4>
					<h4>My favorite color is blue.</h4>
					<h4>My favorite food is kushary.</h4>
					<h4>If I could be any animal, I would be an elephant.</h4>
			<P>Despite their size, they have an enormous capacity for agility and nimbleness in movement. They are able to distribute their weight, or maneuver their feet, so as to apply little pressure while tread softly on unknown or shaky terrain.</p>   
				<p>Another crucial advantageous quality, on average, lies in an impressive reservoir of emotional intelligence. They may be fierce and irritable at times. However, they can also solemn compassion in times of distress, as well as in the mundane interactions of life. Field researchers have gathered much evidence to this regard while observing ceremonies mourning a matriarch, or regular daily tasks like caring for the young.</p>
				<p>Finally, equally captivating is an exhibition of excellent cognitive skills, illustrated in an eclectic array of ways. Phenomenal memory in geo-mapping routes for water and food. Discerning and recalling specific relationships among members of the herd. Or, in critical thinking and problem solving capacities, whether it is the fashioning and usage of tools for tasks, or in the strategizing and implementation of a plan to ward off predators.</p> 
				<p>Similar to humans, the elders and older siblings in elephant herds make gigantic efforts to bequeath accumulated knowledge to the young, spending relatively long dedicated periods of time in rearing phases. That attention to detail vastly distinguishes this mammal. </P>
